Concierge
=========

Mobile wake up call service with a real person.
- User signs up with Facebook, enters their phone number.  
- We verify their number.  
- They type in their wake up call time, proceeded by what information they would like to receive. (Weather, stock quotes, news)
- At the exact time of their wakeup call, Twilio will make a call to an available concierge. 
- Once a concierge picks up, we will connect them with the user for their wakeup call.
- Once a user signs up, they can also choose to become a Concierge.  
- They enter in their Name, phone number, location, and then they record a message as a try out for the job.
- Once finished it sends the recording plus user information straight into the database.  Later accessible via admin.
